# jrpg

This is a WIP game that incorporates elements from other games of the JRPG genre I've played which I am a huge fan of, such as Pokémon, Xenoblade Chronicles, and Chrono Trigger.

A continuation of my [other project,](https://github.com/BitPingu/isekai) but with much more emphasis on story and gameplay mechanics.
